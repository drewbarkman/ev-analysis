# Summary
This README describes a filtered view of the 2024 HPMS Spatial All Sections data with only Interstate sections from the 2024 Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) attached to the All Road Network of Linear Referenced Data (ARNOLD) network.  The source file was produced using what is known as the “Spatial Full Join” process in HPMS, which is a spatial dynamic segmentation of the HPMS data to create homogeneous roadway sections.  To be included in the file, only one data item (not including StateId, RouteId, BeginPoint, EndPoint, SRID, and Year_Record) must be present on a section of road.  See attached README file for more details.  In addition to the Interstate filter (F_System = 1), the data was also filtered to remove any roadway sections restricted to the public (Is_Restricted = 1), sections with missing urban IDs (Urban_ID = 0 or null), and sections identified as a ramp, non-mainline, or planned/unbuilt (Facility_Type = 4, 5, and 7 respectively).  Please note that this view does include data on the non-Inventory direction (Facility_Type = 6), which should be excluded if developing summary statistics, such as total mileages. Failure to exclude the non-inventory direction will result in doubling derived values.  The user is encouraged to reach out to PolicyInfoFeedback@dot.gov with any data or data analysis questions or concerns.

# Dataset summary
- URL: https://datahub.transportation.gov/Roadways-and-Bridges/HPMS-Spatial-Interstate-Sections-2024/npjh-7uup/
- Feature count: 897,918 observations (rows)
- File size: 421,591,577 bytes (CSV)
- Generated: 2025-11-12
- Source data: https://datahub.transportation.gov/Roadways-and-Bridges/HPMS-Spatial-All-Sections-2024/42um-tgh5/
- SHA-256 checksum of source data GeoJSON: a730042bb766978cde6773b558354c55efd71db1744faafe38894db6d81b2713

# Provenance & source
- Source database: HPMS9 (SQL Server)
- Source table: Gold.FullSpatialJoins (as queried by the R script)
- Query filter: DataYear = 2024 AND F_System = 1 AND Is_Restricted is NULL AND Urban_ID > 0 AND Facility_Type in (1, 2, 6) 
- Query ordering: ORDER BY StateId, RouteId, BeginPoint
- Geometry source: Shape.STAsBinary() (WKB/EWKB) and Shape.STSrid (SRID) from the database

# Spatial reference / CRS
CRS used when writing GeoJSON:
If SRID was provided and consistent, the export script attempts to use the SRID found in the source data and, if present, preserves an SRID attribute for each feature. If SRID was missing or inconsistent across rows the script defaults to EPSG:4326. Verify the SRID attribute and reproject as needed for projection-sensitive analysis.

# Geometry
- Input geometry: Source HPMS geometry are M-enabled ESRI polylines (e.g., PolylineM / LINESTRINGM).
- Output geometry: LINESTRING (GeoJSON output does not include M values).
- Empty/invalid geometries: Rows with empty or invalid geometries are excluded from the GeoJSON output. These rows are dropped silently.
- WKB handling: EWKB-aware parsing is used (st_as_sfc(..., EWKB = TRUE)); the script handles raw WKB and hex-encoded WKB text.
- Z values: HPMS data does not contain z values.
- Coordinate Reference System (CRS): WGS84 (EPSG:4326)

Note: HPMS source data contains M values (measures) used for linear referencing; those M values are not included in this GeoJSON. For M-enabled state level HPMS geodatabase/feature-class files, see: https://data.transportation.gov/stories/s/3uu4-47sa

Important: Field names are those produced by the R script. When exporting KML, field names are cleaned and truncated for compatibility; GeoJSON retains the attribute names as in the sf object at write-time.

# Data specifications
The HPMS Field Manual is the data collection guidance for the state data providers and also serves as the HPMS Data Dictionary and can be viewed at: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/fieldmanual/. Please note that changes to the Field Manual are captured in an Errata Sheet which can be viewed at: https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/hpms/fieldmanual/page20.cfm.

# Data types & casting
The SQL in the script explicitly casts many fields to integer, decimal, or varchar types (see script for exact casts). Expect numeric columns (integers/doubles) and textual fields. If strict typing is required, inspect a sample of attributes in R or a GIS tool.

# Usage
Mapping and analyzing roadway inventory, attributes, conditions, and usage, of the Federal-Aid system.  The sample data are included and can be expanded and analyzed where full-extent data are not available. It is recommended that the user consult the HPMS Field Manual on how to do this, or reach out to the FHWA, Office of Highway Policy Information for assistance. It is generally, not advised to compare states, especially using the sampled data items since the collection and reporting of these data can vary from state to state.

# Known limitations & caveats
- M values: M values are not calculated in the GeoJSON export.
- Attribute name modifications: the KML export applies name cleaning/truncation. The GeoJSON should retain original names, but verify if your workflow requires exact original column names.
- Geospatial overlaps are known to exist in some state provided data and are not changed or corrected by HPMS. While this is not an extensive problem, it may be present in this file.
- Users wanting to replicate the data in the FHWA publication Highway Statistics, should be aware that some data items are not provided for rural Minor Collectors and all Local roads.  These data will need to be pulled from the appropriate summary table available on the Data Access for HPMS site at: https://data.transportation.gov/stories/s/3uu4-47sa.
- The data may contain physical spatial gaps. These gaps may be errors created at the source (e.g. during the original digitization of the ARNOLD network) or during data processing in the HPMS application. Gaps created during data processing can occur when there is no reported tabular data to support the ARNOLD network at the location of the gap.
- The data may contain overlapping ARNOLD network (geometry) features that contain different Route IDs, which are not changed or corrected by HPMS. These overlapping features are most prevalent on roadways not owned by a state agency and locations with concurrently running highway numbers. There are also locations where states provide overlapping features that represent the inventory and non-inventory direction.
- Facility Type on Interstates in Iowa do not follow the coding guidance stated within the HPMS Field Manual. Interstates in Iowa in the inventory direction provide Facility Type as equal to “1” instead of “2” where the highway operates with traffic moving in both directions during non-peak periods.
- Curve Classification, Grade Classification, counts of intersection types, and any data item describing intersection geometry or operations should be used with caution when analyzing the Full Join. These items describe the entire sample section or the controlling intersection within that sample as indicated by the associated Sample ID. When these data items are intersected and normalized to create the Full Join, their values will appear within a single homogeneous record that is only a piece of the overall Sample Section. However, they represent the entire Sample Section, which can consist of multiple homogeneous records. Treat the Full Join values for the described data items as aggregates that summarize across the full Sample Section rather than as a single, indivisible observation.

Although these data and associated metadata have been reviewed for accuracy and completeness and approved for release by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), no warranty expressed or implied is made regarding the display or utility of the data for other purposes, nor on all computer systems, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty.
- This data has been approved for release by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

# Reproducibility / script reference
The outputs source data for the were produced by an R script that:
- Connects via DBI + odbc to SQL Server
- Runs the SQL SELECT query (explicit casts) pulling Shape.STAsBinary() and Shape.STSrid
- Converts WKB to sfc using st_as_sfc(..., EWKB = TRUE) (handling raw and hex encodings)
- Removes empty geometries and casts to LINESTRING
- Writes GeoJSON using st_write(..., driver = "GeoJSON")
